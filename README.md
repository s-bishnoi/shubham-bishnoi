I'm an alumni from the University of Waterloo with a Statistics Honours degree and a Computer Science minor. Through my university degree I had the opprotunity to work with various companies in my co-operative education. For past year I have been working as a Data Engineer with the Business Intelligence and Reporting team in TD Bank.

A few things that interest me are A/B/n Testing, Data Visualization, and Automating Data Flows. I have always loved teaching and my goal in life is to be a Data Science professor. 

Fun fact: I love collecting lapel pins, ask me about my collection.
