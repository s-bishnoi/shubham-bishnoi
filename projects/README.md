## Experimental Design

[Link](./projects/ExperimentalDesign/)

The project is on experimenting with different features of the online streaming service to reduce the average browsing time.

*A/B Testing and Hypothesis testing in R* 


## Database Design

[Link](./projects/DatabaseDesign/)

This project is on creating a database that could be used by people to do basic and advanced SQL queries. The database is in 3rd Normal form and most of the data is original (created manually).

*Entity Relation Diagram, Relational model and SQL queries in SQLite* 


## Prediction Model
