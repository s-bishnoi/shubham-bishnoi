Hello! My name is Shubham Bishnoi. I just completed my Statistics Honours degree with a Computer Science minor from University of Waterloo. Few things that interest me are data visualization, A/B testing and working with databases. I am looking for a respectful and creative work environment and team that challenge me to learn new things. I aspire to teach Data Science and Ethics in the future.
