\* The evaluation does not constitute an employment endorsement or recommendation. Employer evaluations
of student contributions and achievements during the work term are conducted as part of the University of Waterloo’s Cooperative (Co-op) Education model. Like academic grades, overall evaluations are part of the assessment of a student’s
progress in the co-op portion of their degree studies. These assessments are completed using criteria set out by the
University, not the employer, and do not reflect the employer’s criteria or assessment metrics.
