I'm an alumni from the University of Waterloo with a Statistics Honours degree and a Computer Science minor. Throughout my university degree, I had the opportunity to work with various companies in my co-operative education. I have been working in Data Science team in Corporate Data & Analytics at TD Bank since 2021.

Some of my interests include A/B/n Testing and Data Visualization. I have always loved teaching and my goal in life is to teach. 

Fun fact: I love collecting lapel pins, ask me about my collection.
